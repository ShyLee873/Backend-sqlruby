SELECT with JOIN practice:

Join the OrderDetails and Products tables, to show a report where the columns are OrderID, ProductName, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.


SELECT o.OrderID, p.ProductName, o.Quantity FROM OrderDetails AS o 
	INNER JOIN Products AS p ON o.ProductID = p.ProductID;


Join the Orders, OrderDetails, and Employees tables to return a report with with the EmployeeName, ProductID, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.  Hint: EmployeeName is not a column in the Employee table, but you can generate a
report with EmployeeName by starting your SQL this way: SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName,


SELECT (EMP.FirstName|| "" || EMP.LastName)AS EmployeeName, ProductID, Quantity FROM OrderDetails AS OOD
	INNER JOIN Orders AS OD ON OOD.OrderID = OD.OrderID
	INNER JOIN Employees AS EMP ON OD.EmployeeID = EMP.EmployeeID;
